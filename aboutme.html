				<p>The pieces I create vary in media, however they come from the same source of inspiration. I am inspired most by my current mood. I create abstract, classical, and digital imagery based on the things I see and the way I feel. Using colors, textures, shapes, and combinations of all of these techniques, I am able to express my creativity in a unique way. Most of the time, I let my medium take me on a journey of exploration. Not knowing what the end product will look like is an incredible and liberating feeling. Without a precise idea of what I want my art to be, I am free to create without any expectations. This style of creation has lead me to surprise myself in so many ways, helping me discover the artist I am and the kind of style I have developed for myself.</p>

				<p>My passion for the arts paired with my web development and user experience knowledge enables me to channel my creative energies into the world of tech and design. I hope to continue being able to use my creative eye to help build innovative, new platforms that are cohesive in design and ultimately solve problems.</p>
